Tree implementation in Javascript
---------------------------------
Trees have been implemented using 2 methods.
1. Using **Node.JS** npm module
    --> Install all the dependencies using npm install.
    --> Run the program through command line by typing node BST-using-node-module.js
2. Using basic tree knowledge and JavaScript objects
    Here, we use the fact that,
    **In JavaScript, almost "everything" is an object.**
    So we using objects to represent trees.
